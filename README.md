1) 'Specimen morphological data.xlsx'
   --------------------- 
   Contains all the specimens examined in natural history museum collections 
   with their corresponding code, species name and country of origin, according to 
   the information available from museum databases. 
   Information about the locality and coordinates was available for most samples. 
   For those where this was missing, we extracted it from recent publications 
   and we assigned specimens to lineages according to the updated distribution maps 
   we derived (column LINEAGE).

   This file also contains the eight external morphological variables measured: 

   - Snout-vent length (SVL) 
   - Mouth length (ML)
   - Head width (HW, measured right behind the eyes)
   - Fore-limb length (FLL, measured between the tip of the 3rd finger and the elbow)
   - Femur length (FemL)
   - Tibia length (TBL)
   - Foot length (FootL, measured from the heel to the tip of the 4th toe)
   - Hind-limb length (HLL, measured separately, representing the total sum length of 
     FemL, TBL and FootL)
 

2) 'Species environmental data.xlsx' 
   ----------------------------
   Contains 14 climatic and one topographic (elevation) variables extracted from 
   WorldClim v.2.1 and NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, respectively. 
   All variables were extracted at 10 minutes resolution (~20 km2) and included average, 
   maximum and minimum values observed across the species' range and their corresponding 
   standard deviations. 
   
   - Precmax: maximum annual values of precipitation (mm)
   - Precmin: minimum annual values of precipitation (mm)
   - Sradavg: average annual values of solar radiation (kJ m-2 day-1)
   - Sradmax: maximum annual values of solar radiation (kJ m-2 day-1)
   - Sradmin: minimum annual values of solar radiation (kJ m-2 day-1)
   - Tavgavg: average monthly temperatures for the average temperature (ºC)
   - Tmaxmax: maximum monthly temperatures for maximum temperature (ºC)
   - Tminmin: minimum monthly temperatures for minimum temperature (ºC)
   - Vaprmax: maximum monthly vapour pressure values (kPa)
   - Vaprmin: minimum monthly vapour pressure values (kPa)
   - Vapravg: average monthly vapour pressure values (kPa)
   - Elevavg: average elevation (m)
   - Elevmax: maximum elevation (m)
   - Elevmin: minimum elevation (m)
